# StudySesh

Project Details: 
This app is designed to help a student connect with different study groups all across the world essentially and fine one that tailors to them. As a student who desperately hoped to find the right study groups, I am trying to see how I can help other students like me. 
This App has features such as making a study group, having filters on different kinds of study group, having a shared notes where different members of the group are able to post and a profile section where the user is able to navigate through their profile and adjust setting. I wanted to make a safe space for everyone to promote education as I believe that education is a very necessary and important aspect in our lives.
